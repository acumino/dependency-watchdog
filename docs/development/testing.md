# Testing Strategy and Developer Guideline

Intent of this document is to introduce you (the developer) to the following:
* Category of tests that exists.
* Libraries that are used to write tests.
* Best practices to write tests that are correct, stable, fast and maintainable.
* How to run each category of tests.

For any new contributions **tests are a strict requirement**. `Boy Scouts Rule` is followed: If you touch a code for which either no tests exist or coverage is insufficient then it is expected that you will add relevant tests.
